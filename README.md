# Streamline

Productivity-oriented VS Code extension packed with features for working on large projects.

## Scoped Paths

Add files and folders into 'scopes' and easily toggle between them to only see what's important.
Useful in large projects and monorepos to focus on modules that you're currently working on.

> This feature is achieved by analyzing your project files and modifying `files.exclude` accordingly.
> Due to VS Code limitations in multi-folder workspaces, not all files are guaranteed to be hidden.

You can also add notes to your bookmarks and archive lists.

## Related Files

Available as an Explorer view and as a command in the Command Palette (`Quick Open Related Files`).

> The extension searches for files whose basename include the current file's basename.
> Priority is given to files within the same parent folder name.
> You can also enable global search across all workspace folders, customize path rendering, and enable stricter search query in the settings.
